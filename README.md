# Polyfill for the [Sanitizer API](https://github.com/WICG/sanitizer-api/) specification.

The polyfill might provide a shim on top of
[DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/), that mainly rewrites the
specified configuration object into a DOMPurify configuration.

DOMPurify is more interesting than other libraries, as it relies on the
current browser's HTML parsing behavior (it is built on top of the
[NodeIterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeIterator)
interface).

### [Demo](https://mozilla.github.io/sanitizer-polyfill/demo/)

There's a [Demo](https://mozilla.github.io/sanitizer-polyfill/demo/) page that loads all of the polyfill scripts and then does nothing.
By default, the polyfill will bail out if you already have a Sanitizer object defined.
But that can be easily overridden by clicking the **Â¶**.

It might useful to test `Element.setHTML`
